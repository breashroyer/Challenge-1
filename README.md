# Challenge-1

Based on whether the challenge is an odd number or an even number will determine if it is a On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge or Job-seeking coding assessments/take-home assignments.
This challenge is an odd-number week, meaning this week's challenge is an on-the-job ticket. I will begin with starter code for me to modify.

This particular challenge, the business is looking for further web accessibility so that those with specific needs can access the content with limited hardship.

The User Story is: 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

The Acceptance Criteria is:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
